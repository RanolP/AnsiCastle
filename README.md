## Why this project exists?

I think the [jansi][jansi-repo] project is dead.
last commit is two months ago,
four [PRs][jansi-prs] are not reviewed and not merged.
And I don't like the api of jansi. :smiley:

For the reasons, I made this project.

## Acknowledgments

- Api style inspired by [importre/crayon][crayon-repo] and [ajalt/mordant][mordant-repo]
- Name inspired by Ansi castle/안시성(安市城) where the [Siege of Ansi][siege-of-ansi] occured.
